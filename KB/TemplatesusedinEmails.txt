Address Update
I ordered these towels as gifts for a lake trip. The trip is next week, but I will be going out of town
before the lake trip and will not be at my house to receive them. Is it too late to send to a different
address? The new address would be Jackie Winkelmann 2210 East Lawther Lane
Deer Park TX 77536. I placed my order this morning. Order #GSandCloud83123

Negative feedback
I appreciate the update. Kind of shocked that DHL basically said, no I don't wanna deliver it, here
you do it. Actually I'm not really surprised, as I have mentioned before, DHL sucks. You guys
make a great product. It is a shame that the late delivery puts a negative vibe on such a great
brand, and on an otherwise very smooth transaction.

Retail store purchases
I bought my XL towel a month ago at your LA store. I’ve only used it a handful of times since but
I’m already seeing threads coming loose (I’ve attached photos of a few). This shouldn’t be
happening within a few uses should it? Those will very easily get caught on stuff and will pull
more threads and I’m worried the product will be compromised.

Unable to add items
Hi I was in the middle of creating this order and I didn’t finish shopping. I wanted to get another
towel and I didn’t get the opportunity to put in the discount code either.
Hi Erica,
Thank you for reaching out. We apologize for the delayed response.
Your order is still in the processing stage. Unfortunately, we do not have an option to add more items as
we do not have authorization to your card details.
The best thing we can do is that we can cancel the order for you so that you can place another order with
all the items of your choice applying the discount code FIREWORKS for 25% off.
Please let us know if you would like to proceed with the order or not.
