Blind Weight scales are designed to provide exposure therapy by allowing the user to engage in the weigh-in process while not directly revealing their weight. This approach helps reduce the anxiety and distress associated with seeing one\'s weight while providing feedback on their progress. Using Blind Weight scales helps patients transition into a lower level of care and eventually become comfortable with open-weighing. Such an approach is vital because it allows the patient to gradually become accustomed to the idea of knowing their weight, which can be a significant source of distress. By enabling them to face the process of weighing without the immediate shock of seeing their actual weight, it helps ease the patient into accepting the process and becoming more comfortable with it over time. This method also ensures that the treatment team can monitor the patient\'s weight and adjust their treatment plan accordingly.\n\nCan I use Blind Weight™ at home?\n\nYes, you can use Blind Weight™ at home to take Blind Weigh-in\'s. As a user you will share the weigh-in\'s with your providers such as a dietiian, clinician, and/or treatment team. You May also invite others to see your measurments, such as a parent, gurdiean, and/or friend.\n\nHow do I calibrate the Blind Weight™ Scale?\n\nCalibrate the scale. Place scale on a hard surface, step on/off and/or tap on scale until you see a “0” value on display. See Video guide - https://www.instagram.com/p/ClCKqKIp7wh/\n\nDoes the user/patient need to access the portal?\n\nNo, the patient/user does not need to access the Blind Weight™ Portal. The portal is designed for the providers and/or parents to retrieve the Blind Weight™ measurement data.\n\nScale maximum weight limit?\n\n400lbs is the maximum weight limit .\n\nHow to record your measurement?\n\nRecord your code by taking a picture, writing it down, and/or submitting to the Blind Weight™ user portal.\n\nHow do I register as a provider?\n\nOn the main page at Blindweight.com click on Register as a Provider/Parent and fill out the form.\n\nWhat is the point of a smart scale?\n\nAnswer will be updated\n\nHow do I get my patient’s weight?\n\nHave your patient send you a picture of the Blind Weight™ code by text or email.\n\nOnce I register, when will my account be approved?\n\nIt usually takes 24-48 hours for your provider account to be approved if you have a company domain email. If you don’t have a company domain email please send us an email to expedite your account. As soon as your account is approved you will get an email.\n\nWhy is taking blind weigh-in measurements for eating disorder patients important?\n\naking blind weigh-in measurements for eating disorder patients is important because it helps to prevent patients from manipulating their weight by dehydrating themselves or purging before weigh-ins. Additionally, the blind weigh-in helps to ensure that weight changes are accurately reflected, and provides a more accurate picture of the patient\'s progress in treatment. It also helps to establish trust between the patient and the healthcare professional and reduces the focus on the patient\'s weight as the sole measure of progress.\n\nWhy are blind weigh-ins less triggering to eating disorder patients then that of seeing the weight measurement?\n\nBlind weigh-ins are less triggering to eating disorder patients because they remove the emphasis on the number on the scale and instead focus on the patient\'s overall progress and health. For someone with an eating disorder, the number on the scale can have a powerful psychological impact, and can be a source of anxiety and distress. Additionally, seeing the number on the scale can perpetuate the cycle of disordered thoughts and behaviors associated with the disorder. By removing the emphasis on the number on the scale, blind weigh-ins can help patients to focus on their overall health and well-being, rather than getting fixated on the number on the scale.\n\nHow many people are suffering from eating disorders\n\nEating disorders are a serious and complex mental health condition that affects millions of people globally. According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), it is estimated that 20 million women and 10 million men in the United States will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. Eating disorders are not limited to a specific demographic and can affect people of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Eating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of any mental illness. It\'s important to note that these numbers may be underestimated, as eating disorders often go undiagnosed and unreported.\n\nHow is Blind Weight different than other competitors?\n\nBlind Weight is different from other competitors because of our focus on simplicity and affordability. We have developed a numberless scale that is easy to use, affordable, and does not require any additional steps for the user to take. Other competitors may offer similar products, but they often come with additional requirements or steps that can impede treatment.  For example, some competitors may require users to access a portal or log into an app to view their weight, which can be a barrier for individuals who are not tech-savvy or have limited access to technology. Blind Weight\'s numberless scale is designed to be simple and easy to use, with no additional steps required for the user to take.  Additionally, Blind Weight offers free tools for those suffering from eating disorders in addition to creating an easy place for patients to find specialized clinicians that work with Blind Weight scales. Our company is committed to providing a comprehensive solution that supports individuals throughout their recovery journey.  Overall, Blind Weight\'s focus on simplicity, affordability, and comprehensive support sets us apart from other competitors in the market. We are dedicated to making a real difference in people\'s lives and providing a more supportive environment for individuals sensitive to weight exposure.\n\nwhy is virtual eating disorder treatment effective?\n\nVirtual eating disorder treatment can be effective for a number of reasons. One reason is that it allows for greater flexibility and convenience for the patient. For example, virtual treatment can be accessed from anywhere and at any time, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals who may have difficulty attending in-person appointments due to work, school or location constraints.  Another reason virtual treatment can be effective is that it can provide anonymity, which can be helpful for individuals who may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their eating disorder. Additionally, virtual treatment can be less intimidating, which can make it more accessible for individuals who may be hesitant to seek treatment in person.  Virtual treatment can also provide access to specialists and evidence-based treatment methods that may not be available in all areas, which can be especially beneficial for individuals who live in rural or remote locations.  Finally, virtual treatment can also provide a means of continuing treatment after an individual has completed an inpatient or residential program, which can be critical for maintaining progress and preventing relapse.  It\'s important to note that virtual treatment should be provided by qualified and licensed professionals, who are trained to provide treatment for eating disorders, and should be combined with other forms of treatment such as, in-person therapy, medical supervision, and nutritional counseling if necessary.\n\nHow does Blind Weight ensure affordability and accessibility for its users?\n\nAt Blind Weight, we firmly believe that affordability equals accessibility. We\'ve designed Blind Weight to be affordable so that the majority of the population can have access to taking Blind Weights without financial barriers. Our approach involves optional parent accounts, which carry a one-time fee of $20.\n\nCan we purchase several and then lend them out?\n\nWe\'ve designed Blind Weight with a focus on making it accessible to everyone, especially those who may have financial constraints or may be at different stages of their healing journey.  Regarding your question, yes, you can absolutely purchase several Blind Weight scales and lend them out to your clients. Each scale can be used multiple times by different individuals without any restrictions. The scale itself doesn\'t connect to a specific user account, so it can be shared among clients as needed. This approach can be a wonderful way to support clients who may be hesitant or have financial concerns, allowing them to experience the benefits of Blind Weight without any initial obstacles.  Our goal is to provide a sensitive and practical solution that aligns with the diverse needs of individuals seeking weight-tracking alternatives.\n\nHow Does the Coding System Work?\n\nthe codes are not as straightforward as a simple "up" or "down." We embed the weight data into the lettered error codes displayed on the scale. The algorithm used is quite intricate and involves a specific equation. As a result, it\'s not something that a user can easily decipher without access to another calibrated device.  Blind Weight was designed with the primary goal of providing a less-triggering and alternative option to traditional blind weights. Our intention is to reduce the anxiety and shock associated with taking blind weights. We achieve this by obscuring the measurement for the user and providing exposure therapy.  Blind Weight can be seen as a middle ground between open and closed weigh-ins. The scale is designed to resemble a standard floor scale, using the same font and characters. This familiarization helps users become more comfortable with the weigh-in process. Our ultimate objective is to reduce triggering experiences by providing a milder version of the weigh-in process.\n\nFAQ\'s for Parent and Provider\n\nHow do I register as a parent?\n\nOn the main page at Blindweight.com click on Register as a Provider/Parent and fill out the form.\n\nOnce i register when will my account be approved?\n\nYour parent account will only be approved once you send us an email to info@blindweight.com.

Blind weight scales are a revolutionary solution for taking blind weigh-ins, especially for individuals sensitive to weight exposure, such as those in eating disorder recovery. By removing the emphasis on the number on the scale, blind weigh-ins can help patients to focus on their overall health and well-being rather than getting fixated on the number on the scale.\n\nWhy are numberless scales becoming more popular ?\n\nNumberless scales are becoming more popular because they provide a more supportive environment for individuals sensitive to weight exposure. For someone with an eating disorder, the number on the scale can have a powerful psychological impact and can be a source of anxiety and distress. Additionally, seeing the number on the scale can perpetuate the cycle of disordered thoughts and behaviors associated with the disorder.  By removing the emphasis on the number on the scale, blind weigh-ins can help patients to focus on their overall health and well-being rather than getting fixated on the number on the scale. This approach aligns with the modern perspective of treating eating disorders, which emphasizes the importance of taking a holistic approach to treatment and focusing on overall health and well-being, rather than weight and body shape.  Moreover, numberless scales can also be beneficial for individuals who struggle with weight stigma or anxiety surrounding their weight. By eliminating the number on the scale, individuals can step onto the scale without experiencing anxiety or negative feelings that may be associated with seeing a specific number.  Overall, the popularity of numberless scales is driven by a growing awareness of the importance of providing a supportive environment for individuals sensitive to weight exposure and an emphasis on overall health and well-being in eating disorder recovery.\n\nOnce I receive a code from my patient, what do I do?\n\nLogin to the portal that your account was approved for at https://app.blindweight.com.
